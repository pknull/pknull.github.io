  content: "Along the shore the cloud waves break, the twin suns sink behind the lake, the shadows lengthen in Carcosa. Strange is the night where black stars rise, and strange moons circle through the skies, but stranger still is lost Carcosa. Songs that the Hyades shall sing, where flap the tatters of the King, must die unheard in dim Carcosa. Song of my soul, my voice is dead, die thou unsung as tears unshed shall dry and die in lost Carcosa. I remember after finishing the first act that it occurred to me that I had better stop. I started up and flung the book into the fireplace; the volume struck the barred grate and fell open on the hearth in the firelight. If I had not caught a glimpse of the opening words in the second act I should never have finished it, but as I stooped to pick it up, my eyes became riveted to the open page, and with a cry of terror, or perhaps it was of joy so poignant that I suffered in every nerve, I snatched the thing out of the coals and crept shaking to my bedroom, where I read it and reread it, and wept and laughed and trembled with a horror which at times assails me yet. This is the thing that troubles me, for I cannot forget Carcosa where black stars hang in the heavens; where the shadows of men's thoughts lengthen in the afternoon, when the twin suns sink into the lake of Hali; and my mind will bear for ever the memory of the Pallid Mask. I pray God will curse the writer, as the writer has cursed the world with this beautiful, stupendous creation, terrible in its simplicity, irresistible in its truth—a world which now trembles before the King in Yellow. When the French Government seized the translated copies which had just arrived in Paris, London, of course, became eager to read it. It is well known how the book spread like an infectious disease, from city to city, from continent to continent, barred out here, confiscated there, denounced by Press and pulpit, censured even by the most advanced of literary anarchists. No definite principles had been violated in those wicked pages, no doctrine promulgated, no convictions outraged. It could not be judged by any known standard, yet, although it was acknowledged that the supreme note of art had been struck in The King in Yellow, all felt that human nature could not bear the strain, nor thrive on words in which the essence of purest poison lurked. The very banality and innocence of the first act only allowed the blow to fall afterward with more awful effect. Camilla: You, sir, should unmask. Stranger: Indeed? Cassilda: Indeed it's time. We have all laid aside disguise but you. Stranger: I wear no mask. Camilla: No mask? No mask! The Phantom of Truth was laid. Along the shore the cloud waves break, the twin suns sink behind the lake, the shadows lengthen in Carcosa. Have you found the Yellow Sign? Have you found the Yellow Sign? Have you found the Yellow Sign? I opened my eyes. The night lamp was burning and something rustled on the floor beside me. I could not identify it at first until I saw that it was the book called The King in Yellow. Then I noticed something crouching by the window with its white face turned toward me. There was no doubt about it. That pallid mask looked into mine for an eternity. It was the Repairer of Reputations. Beyond the mountains lay the Lake of Hali. The phantom of truth had laid aside its cloak. The scalloped tatters of the King must hide Yhtill forever. I cannot forget the shadows of men's thoughts lengthen in the afternoon. Hastur. Aldebaran. The Hyades. The Lake of Hali. Carcosa. The Pallid Mask. The Yellow Sign. The King in Yellow. Along the shore the cloud waves break, the twin suns sink behind the lake, the shadows lengthen in Carcosa. Strange is the night where black stars rise, and strange moons circle through the skies, but stranger still is lost Carcosa. Songs that the Hyades shall sing, where flap the tatters of the King, must die unheard in dim Carcosa. Song of my soul, my voice is dead, die thou unsung as tears unshed shall dry and die in lost Carcosa. The music of steel brushing against steel, the mellow shock of the mallet on thigh pieces, and the jingle of chain armour. I loved to hear the golden tinkle on the greave plates. My eyes would become fixed, dilating with a pleasure that stretched every nerve almost to breaking. Still thrilling secretly I leaned back and listened again to the sound of the polishing rag. There a painless death awaits him who can no longer bear the sorrows of this life. If death is welcome let him seek it there. The solemn hush was broken by a sharp cry of command. I left the crowd to gape and stare at the white marble Death Chamber. Along the shore the cloud waves break. The twin suns sink. The shadows lengthen. In Carcosa. Have you found the Yellow Sign? His mind is a wonder chamber from which he can extract treasures that you and I would give years of our lives to acquire. Nothing however trivial escapes his search and his memory is so absolute so precise in details that were it known in New York that such a man existed the people could not honour him enough. The soft clash of the mail sent a thrill of pleasure through me. I would sit for hours listening and listening. When a stray sunbeam struck the inlaid steel the sensation it gave me was almost too keen to endure. My eyes would become fixed dilating with a pleasure that stretched every nerve almost to breaking. Along the shore the cloud waves break, the twin suns sink behind the lake, the shadows lengthen in Carcosa. Strange is the night where black stars rise, and strange moons circle through the skies, but stranger still is lost Carcosa. Songs that the Hyades shall sing, where flap the tatters of the King, must die unheard in dim Carcosa. Song of my soul, my voice is dead, die thou unsung as tears unshed shall dry and die in lost Carcosa. I climbed the three dilapidated flights of stairs which I had so often climbed before and knocked at a small door at the end of the corridor. When he had double-locked the door and pushed a heavy chest against it he came and sat down beside me peering up into my face with his little light-coloured eyes. Half a dozen new scratches covered his nose and cheeks. I thought I had never seen him so hideously fascinating. He had no ears. The artificial ones which now stood out at an angle from the fine wire were his one weakness. They were made of wax and painted a shell pink but the rest of his face was yellow. He was very small scarcely higher than a child of ten but his arms were magnificently developed and his thighs as thick as any athlete's. Still the most remarkable thing about him was that a man of his marvellous intelligence and knowledge should have such a head. It was flat and pointed like the heads of many of those unfortunates whom people imprison in asylums for the weak-minded. Many called him insane but I knew him to be as sane as I was. Have you found the Yellow Sign? Have you found the Yellow Sign? Along the shore the cloud waves break, the twin suns sink behind the lake, the shadows lengthen in Carcosa. Strange is the night where black stars rise, and strange moons circle through the skies, but stranger still is lost Carcosa. The King in Yellow. The Pallid Mask. The Lake of Hali. Hastur. Aldebaran. The Hyades. Carcosa. The Yellow Sign. I cannot forget Carcosa where black stars hang in the heavens where the shadows of men's thoughts lengthen in the afternoon when the twin suns sink into the lake of Hali and my mind will bear forever the memory of the Pallid Mask. Along the shore the cloud waves break, the twin suns sink behind the lake, the shadows lengthen in Carcosa. Strange is the night where black stars rise, and strange moons circle through the skies, but stranger still is lost Carcosa. Songs that the Hyades shall sing, where flap the tatters of the King, must die unheard in dim Carcosa. Song of my soul, my voice is dead, die thou unsung as tears unshed shall dry and die in lost Carcosa. I do not deny that he was eccentric; the mania he had for keeping that cat and teasing her until she flew at his face like a demon, was certainly eccentric. I never could understand why he kept the creature, nor what pleasure he found in shutting himself up in his room with this surly, vicious beast. I remember once, glancing up from the manuscript I was studying by the light of some tallow dips, and seeing Mr. Wilde squatting motionless on his high chair, his eyes fairly blazing with excitement, while the cat, which had risen from her place before the stove, came creeping across the floor right at him. Before I could move she flattened her belly to the ground, crouched, trembled, and sprang into his face. Howling and foaming they rolled over and over on the floor, scratching and clawing, until the cat screamed and fled under the cabinet, and Mr. Wilde turned over on his back, his limbs contracting and curling up like the legs of a dying spider. He was eccentric. Along the shore the cloud waves break, the twin suns sink behind the lake, the shadows lengthen in Carcosa. Strange is the night where black stars rise, and strange moons circle through the skies, but stranger still is lost Carcosa. Songs that the Hyades shall sing, where flap the tatters of the King, must die unheard in dim Carcosa. Song of my soul, my voice is dead, die thou unsung as tears unshed shall dry and die in lost Carcosa. The entries in the ledger were written in a hand I did not recognize. Names and dates filled the yellowed pages, each line a record of some transaction I could not comprehend. The ink had faded to a pale rust color but the words remained legible. I turned page after page finding nothing but these cryptic notations. What business was conducted here? What accounts were settled in this chamber? The ledger offered no answers only more questions. I closed the book and set it aside. Some records are best left unread. Some debts are best left uncollected. The shadows in the room seemed to deepen as I sat there contemplating the weight of forgotten obligations. Along the shore the cloud waves break, the twin suns sink behind the lake, the shadows lengthen in Carcosa. Have you found the Yellow Sign? Have you found the Yellow Sign? Have you found the Yellow Sign? I had brought the book with me. I laid it open on the table by the window. Mr. Wilde squinted at it for a moment, then when his eye caught the Yellow Sign he seemed suddenly to become rigid. I asked him if he knew any thing about the King in Yellow, but he did not answer me. His eyes followed the pattern of the Yellow Sign with the fixed stare of a somnambulist, and his lips moved as if he was reading something. Then the spell was broken. He began to laugh softly. I was intensely interested. He laughed a long time, then closing his eyes he murmured, speaking to himself: 'The King in Yellow. The King in Yellow.' 'Do you know the play?' I asked. He nodded. 'I have read it,' he said. I looked at him in surprise. 'Then you know the King in Yellow?' He seemed to droop and grow feebler still. 'I am the King in Yellow,' he said. Along the shore the cloud waves break, the twin suns sink behind the lake, the shadows lengthen in Carcosa. Strange is the night where black stars rise, and strange moons circle through the skies, but stranger still is lost Carcosa. Songs that the Hyades shall sing, where flap the tatters of the King, must die unheard in dim Carcosa. Song of my soul, my voice is dead, die thou unsung as tears unshed shall dry and die in lost Carcosa. The King in Yellow. The Pallid Mask. The Lake of Hali. Hastur. Aldebaran. The Hyades. Carcosa. The Yellow Sign. Have you found the Yellow Sign? Along the shore the cloud waves break, the twin suns sink behind the lake, the shadows lengthen in Carcosa. Strange is the night where black stars rise, and strange moons circle through the skies, but stranger still is lost Carcosa.

Song of my soul, my voice is dead, die thou unsung as tears unshed shall dry and die in lost Carcosa. Night fell and the gas lamps were lit by the pallid figure who moved through the fog-shrouded streets. I watched from my window as the yellow light flickered and danced against the darkened panes. In the distance I could hear the church bells tolling the hour, each strike echoing through the empty corridors of memory. The manuscript lay open before me, its pages yellowed with age, the ink faded but still legible in the lamplight. I traced the words with trembling fingers knowing that to read further was to invite madness into my chamber. Yet I could not stop. The story pulled me forward through veils of shadow and dream. I thought of the lake and the twin suns and the city that was not a city. I thought of the mask that was no mask at all. The night grew deeper and still I read. The words seemed to writhe upon the page, rearranging themselves into new configurations each time I blinked. Was this the power of the Yellow Sign? Was this how it claimed its victims? Outside the fog pressed against my window like something alive and hungry. I fancied I could see shapes moving within it, tall figures in tattered robes processing through the murk toward some unknowable destination. The bells continued to toll though now they seemed to count not hours but years, centuries, aeons of time beyond human reckoning. Along the shore the cloud waves break, the twin suns sink behind the lake, the shadows lengthen in Carcosa. I laid down the manuscript and pressed my palms against my eyes. When I removed them the room had changed. The walls had receded to an impossible distance and above me stretched not ceiling but sky, black and vast, pierced by stars that burned with cold malevolence. I stood upon a shore of black sand and before me lay waters of absolute stillness reflecting twin suns that hung low upon the horizon casting long shadows that reached toward me like grasping fingers. And across that lake, half-hidden by mist, rose the spires and towers of a city whose name I dared not speak. The Pallid Mask. The King in Yellow. Have you found the Yellow Sign? Strange is the night where black stars rise, and strange moons circle through the skies, but stranger still is lost Carcosa. I blinked and I was back in my room, the manuscript before me, the gas lamp guttering in its sconce. But something had changed. Upon my desk, where no object had rested before, lay a sign, carved in some unknown substance that gleamed yellow in the lamplight. I did not touch it. I knew better than to touch it. But I could not look away. The curves of its design seemed to move, to pulse with a life of their own, drawing my gaze deeper and deeper into their infinite complexity. Aldebaran. The Hyades. Hastur. These words repeated in my mind like an incantation, like a prayer to gods best left unnamed. The fog outside had thickened. I could no longer see the street below. I could see nothing but yellow, yellow everywhere, the color of ancient parchment, of dying suns, of madness incarnate. And somewhere in that yellow murk a figure moved, tall and thin, draped in tatters that fluttered though no wind stirred. It turned toward my window and where its face should have been I saw only pallor, only smoothness, only the absence of all feature. The Phantom of Truth. The King himself. I understood then why the book had been banned, why governments had trembled at its publication, why those who read it were forever changed. It was not the words themselves but what the words awakened, what ancient compact they invoked, what door they opened between the world of men and the shores of that terrible lake where Carcosa waits, eternal and patient, for all who bear the Yellow Sign. Song of my soul, my voice is dead, die thou unsung as tears unshed shall dry and die in lost Carcosa. Have you found the Yellow Sign? Have you found the Yellow Sign? Have you found the Yellow Sign?" !important;
