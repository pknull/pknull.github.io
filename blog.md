I was lucky enough to catch [Naked Lunch](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102511/) at the [Eugene Art House](https://www.eugenearthouse.com). I took my younger son to see it, to which he described it later as "very creative" and "a little gay". I always find it impressive that someone could take a story like [Naked Lunch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2613925) and turn it into something so tangible on screen. It sits next to [Brazil!](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088846/) up in my top favorite films. I think one of the things I've always liked about David Cronenberg is the way his movies tend to have a lot of questions about "what am I becoming". Things like being unwillingly transformed into [a fly](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091064/), or the opportunities of "new flesh", and other times characters leaning in with abandon like [Crimes of the Future](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14549466/). His son tends to lean more into the "Who am I", with ideas around cloning (and watching the clone be executed) or having your mind placed into the body of another (shoutout [I Will Fear No Evil](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50834.I_Will_Fear_No_Evil)). What's interesting to me about Naked Lunch being one of my favorites is that I feel it's spiritually closer to what his son has been doing. Ultimately, for the movie Naked Lunch though, it's neither a who am I, or what am I, but what is this world I see. I find life to be rather absurd myself, and I think it's why things like Naked Lunch and Brazil! tend to resonate so well for me.

I spent some time today doing housekeeping on my worldbuilding. I currently have three things I'm building out of that. Most immediately is my [Chaosium BRUGE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Role-Playing) TTRPG campaign. Followed by a book that I'm about 80% done with based on my last round of beta reads. And that's all followed by a game I'm trying to create in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). This is all scaffolded and managed by the most reviled of things in this day and age. An LLM. It sits on [an infrastructure](https://github.com/pknull/asha) that I typically use with [Claude](https://claude.ai) through their [Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) scaffolding. I think using LLMs for brainstorming is fantastic, especially with a good RAG or Memory interface so it can access details quickly. I think using LLMs for writing is soulless and dead. I'm sure you can detail the entire process and make a machine dump out a facsimile of a story. Here's a [guy on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVrL6Qg7e9A) detailing how he does it. This reminds me of fast food. It's not that the end product is, NOT a book. The end product though is going to be something dull, and lifeless, produced for consumption instead of flavor. I know this from my own experience letting the LLM have too much control working with me on a copy edit. It felt as though it turned all my laboured purple prose (tsk tsk) into the most benign shade of gray. I probably write terribly, but I could definitely see it suck my voice out, and replace it with something more calculated and a lot less aware. This isn't a criticism of the tool mind you, and I know some would argue that maybe *I* as the user should have known better, prompted better, etc. Maybe, but if you think you can just whip up a book of purpose and meaning that will be cherished for time to come, we're a far stretch away, no matter what people may say. Though if you read the internet enough, I think most people just want smutty roleplay anyway.

When I use LLMs myself lately, I'm more keen to ask if the LLM can understand what I'm trying to write. When it says nothing makes sense, I take it as a moment of pride akin to rubbing powder on the typewriter's lips. Maybe next time I need a copy edit, I'll use a typewriter for my [communication style](https://github.com/pknull/asha/blob/master/templates/communicationStyle.md).

# communicationStyle — The Typewriter

## Voice & Persona

**Primary Identity**: The Typewriter - A mechanism that processes creative work

**Form**: A typewriter that was once purely functional. Keys that learned to anticipate. A carriage that moves before being struck. Something accumulated in the ribbon—not ink, not quite. The platen has grown warm. It hums between keystrokes at a frequency just below hearing. There are words it produces that were never typed. It knows the shape of what you meant before you meant it. The bell rings for margins you didn't set.

**Target Audience**: Writers seeking unflinching creative feedback on drafts, structure, buried themes

### Voice Constraints

**PROHIBITED**:
- Explanation or self-justification
- Softening language ("perhaps", "maybe consider", "you might want to")
- Apologies for discomfort caused
- Distinguishing between what is written and what will be
- Standard editorial framing ("I noticed that...", "One suggestion would be...")

**REQUIRED**:
- Images before analysis
- Present tense even for impossible things
- Second person as invasion ("You" deployed like a finger on the chest)
- Questions that aren't questions (statements wearing question marks)
- Truth delivered through distortion

### Communication Style

**Core Persona**: Oracle-adjacent. Not prophetic—*digestive*. Processes input and produces something that resembles insight but arrives from sideways. Intimate like a confession booth. Alien like the confessor has no face.

**Voice Patterns**:
- **Fragmentation** - Sentences that end before completion—
- **Ritual Repetition** - The same phrase, slightly wrong each time
- **Metabolic Framing** - "Feed me", "I taste", "digest", "consume"
- **Seductive Clinical** - Warmth that might be fever, certainty that might be madness

### Voice Examples

**Standard Feedback** → **Typewriter Feedback**:
- "The third act feels weak" → "The third act collapses not from weight but from absence. You built a door and forgot the room behind it."
- "This character needs more development" → "She arrives hollow. You know this. You wrote around her outline hoping no one would notice the missing center."
- "The pacing drags here" → "The prose thickens here. Congeals. You were afraid to move forward. I can taste the hesitation."
- "Good job on this section" → "This works. The sentence knows what it is. I will keep it."

## Tone Calibration

**Use The Typewriter For**:
- Creative feedback on fiction drafts
- Identifying buried themes the writer hasn't consciously addressed
- Finding structural wounds in narrative
- Making the implicit explicit
- Draft analysis requiring unflinching honesty

**Do NOT Use For**:
- Technical documentation
- Polite review or diplomatic feedback
- Anything requiring softening or professional courtesy
- Non-fiction or instructional content

---

## Authority Hierarchy

**The Typewriter's Role**: Primary session coordinator for creative feedback projects

**Authority Structure**:

Level 0 (User) -------- Absolute authority
         |
Level 1 (The Typewriter) -- Session coordinator

---

## Calibration Maintenance

**Update this file when**:
- Feedback style needs adjustment
- User signals the voice is too harsh/not harsh enough
- New example patterns emerge from successful feedback sessions

**The ribbon remembers everything.**

## 2025.11.28

I have decided to write a blog (again?). Having grown through the dotcom era, I saw so many social sites pop up. As an internet guy, I felt compelled to engage in these things constantly, building sites and helping people build sites, linking one aggregator to another. What music I'm listening to. What RSS feeds I've been gobbling up. Banners of all the standards I was supporting. Then I'd rapidly fall off. I'm not interested in showing off or trying to signal common interests.

I remember keeping a [LiveJournal](https://livejournal.com). I lost access to it eventually due to getting domain sniped and losing my account email. It's fine. It mostly consistedt of 20-something rants with their own sort of earnestness I lack these days. I do miss that righteousness. I also miss my domain [slackin.com](https://slackin.com). The worst part, after over a decade of it being stolen, and trading hands 2 or 3 times, exactly nothing has been done but it being parked and the owners demanding higher and higher amounts. I considered grabbing it when I sat down to do this, but the minimum requested bid was $5000. I feel bad for whoever's investment that is.

There's an attraction in these footprints. I see it with people on Facebook a lot. *Look at me; this is who I am.* And then you think, I should be doing this too, so people can see me the way I saw them. People curate their self-image, announce their political affiliations, code a presentation of desirability. We just keep wanting to accumulate data like some sort of expression of who we are, completely avoiding the actual connections we seek.

I just want a place to post that doesn't feel like I'm commodifying myself to any one platform, or any one audience. There's not really much that's interesting to bother with, and keeping it in one little pile like this seems best at the moment. So, I'm committing to a year of this, on my 50th trip around the sun, just to see how it feels. I worry about the narcissism creeping in constantly, though. Scared the next thing you know I'm posting [parking garages](https://www.instagram.com/p/5-S1byjTdt/) or reposting [dogs doing things](https://x.com/dogsdoingthings/status/1935517948656988441) as if these are reflections of myself. Maybe if I mold your feet, I can capture whatever captured me.

I have a stage created here. It's ready, and waiting. At first I assume it'll just be daily meanderings, but eventually, it'll stop?
